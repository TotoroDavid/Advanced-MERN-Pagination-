# Advanced-MERN-Pagination-

in the next project, I was working on a simple MERN application building a fully functioning and dynamic app that implements some advanced pagination. I will be using React, Express, and MongoDB for this project. Pagination is an important topic in web development as it improves websites loading time as well as overall user experience. So I made this project covering everything and ​to production on the internet using Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.
